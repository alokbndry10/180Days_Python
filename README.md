**Day1 of 180 Days of Python!**
- Today I learned how to work with variables.I learned to use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise, what strings are and how to display them using lowercase, uppercase, and title case.I started using whitespace to organizeoutput neatly, and I learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string.I started working with integers and floats.I learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data.Ialso learned to write explanatory comments to make my code easier for me and others to read.Finally, I read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as possible, whenever possible.
Next day,l will learn how to store collections of information in
data structures called lists. Youâ€™ll also learn how to work through a list,
manipulating any information in that list.
