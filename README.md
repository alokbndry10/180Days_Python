# Summary on 180 Days of Python


**I planned on switching my primary programming language from C and C++ to python and am learning it from scratch this file contains summary of things i learnt during my 180 days of python from day 1 to day 180.**

**Day1 of 180 Days of Python!**
-Day 1:Today I learned how to work with variables.I learned to use descriptive variable names and resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise, what strings are and how to display them using lowercase, uppercase, and title case.I started using whitespace to organizeoutput neatly, and I learned how to remove unneeded elements from a string.I started working with integers and floats.I learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data.Ialso learned to write explanatory comments to make my code easier for me and others to read.Finally, I read about the philosophy of keeping your code as simple as possible, whenever possible.

-Next day,l will learn how to store collections of information in
data structures called lists. I will also learn how to work through a list,
manipulating any information in that list.

**Day2 of 180 Days of Python!**
-Day 2:Today I Mastered list manipulation in Python: defined, added, removed, and sorted elements efficiently. Explored length determination and index error avoidance. Next up, optimizing list operations through efficient looping.

-Next day,l will learn Diving into advanced list manipulation and efficient information retrieval. Ready to unlock the power of Python lists for streamlined data handling. Excited to enhance my coding skills!

**Day3 of 180 Days of Python!**
-Today's focus was on mastering lists in Python:

1️⃣ Explored the efficiency of loops for iterating through entire lists.
2️⃣ Navigated the importance of indentation to avoid tricky errors.
3️⃣ Delved into managing numerical lists for effective data handling.
4️⃣ Learned to manipulate specific list elements for targeted actions.
5️⃣ Met tuples and uncovered their unique characteristics in Python data structures.
6️⃣ Polished my code styling, adhering to Python conventions for readability.
